# PHP-based Guestbook

This repo contains the files for a school project. The project's goal is to set up a HTML form that sends data to a mySQL database using **PHP**. Please note, that it was explicitly mentioned to solve this challenge using a one-file-solution. It wasn't our choice to pack the whole code into a single file.

## Tasks and Responsibilities

- **Backend Development and Database Modelling**: Bartosz Burgiel
