# PHP-based Guestbook

This repo contains the files for a school project. The project's goal is to set up a **HTML** form that sends data to a **mySQL** database using **PHP**. Please note that it was required to solve this challenge by a single file approach. If we had have the choice, the code would be encapsualted and separated by concern.
